# Cluster-Analysis

In this project I perform an exploratory data analysis for three different clustering problems. The first section of this project focuses on a European Employment dataset, a datsetset showing the percentage employed in different industries in Europe countries during 1979. I use multivariate techniques, such as cluster analysis and principal components analysis to examine which countries have similar employment patterns. The second part of this project uses the USSTATES dataset. The data, calculated from census data, consists of state-wide average or proportion scores for the non-demographic variables. I use this data set to conduct a hierarchical cluster analysis. The final part of this project uses the RECIDIVISM dataset. The data consists of a random sample records on convicts released from prison during 1977/1978. I use this data set to conduct a k-means cluster analysis.
